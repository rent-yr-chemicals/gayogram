* Messages with both media and text, including animated media
* Unobtrusive display of subject lines, where present
* Links to known contacts are shown with their name
* Show timestamps for calls
* Integrates with gateways' add contact flows
* When using a gateway to the phone network, integrate with the native Android Phone app
* Address book integration
* Tag contacts and channels and browse by tag
* Command UI

Where to get service:

Cheogram Android requires you have an account with a Jabber service.  You can run your own service, or use one provided by someone else, for example: https://snikket.org/hosting/
