# üè≥‚Äçüåà Cheogram? More like *Gay*ogram! üè≥‚Äçüåà

This is a fork of [Cheogram Android](https://git.singpolyma.net/cheogram-android). It *should* be identical to Cheogram, but with a gayer color scheme and infinitely more mommy.

Be gay. Do crime. See CHANGELOG.md for details.

# Cheogram Android

This is a fork of [Conversations](https://conversations.im) to implement features of use to the [Sopranica](https://soprani.ca) project.

The Cheogram Android app allows you to join a worldwide communication network.  It especially focuses on features useful to users who want to contact those on other networks as well, such as SMS-enabled phone numbers.

Based on the app Conversations, but with unique features:

* Messages with both media and text, including animated media
* Unobtrusive display of subject lines, where present
* Links to known contacts are shown with their name
* Show timestamps for calls
* Integrates with gateways' add contact flows
* When using a gateway to the phone network, integrate with the native Android Phone app
* Address book integration
* Tag contacts and channels and browse by tag
* Command UI

## Contributing

If you have code or patches you wish to contribute, the maintainer's preferred mechanism is a git pull request.  Push your changes to a git repository somewhere, for example:

    git remote rename origin upstream
    git remote add origin git@git.sr.ht:~yourname/cheogram-android
    git push -u origin master

Then generate the pull request:

    git fetch upstream master
    git request-pull -p upstream/master origin

And copy-paste the result into a plain-text email to: dev@singpolyma.net

You may alternately use a patch-based approach as described on https://git-send-email.io

Contributions follow an inbound=outbound model -- you (or your employer) keep all copyright on your patches, but agree to license them according to this project's COPYING file.
